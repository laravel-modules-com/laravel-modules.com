Thank you for contributing!

## Getting Started

Be sure to fork and clone the repo: `gh repo clone NativePHP/nativephp.com`

Make a branch for what change you want to contribute and open a pull request to the upstream main branch.

## Torchlight

The documentation uses [torchlight.dev](torchlight.dev) for syntax highlighting.

Without a token, you will run into an error on pages like "/docs/desktop/1/getting-started/introduction".

To get set up:

1. Create an account and then make a new API token [here](https://torchlight.dev/account/api-tokens).
2. Then set the API token in the .env.

```
TORCHLIGHT_TOKEN=<token>
```
